    <h1>General Information</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This course introduces you to a simplified OS called xv6
      developed in C and RISC-V assembly. Students will learn through
      a combination of hands-on labs, interactive lectures as well as
      numerous books and publications. The topics range from the
      basics of page tables and thread scheduling to device drivers
      and new high-level languages (HLL) being developed to create
      secure and robust kernels. Students will need to have a basic
      working knowledge of C and assembly.
    </p>
    <h2>Texts</h2>
    <p>The following book(s) will be provided for the students:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="xv6/book-riscv-rev4.pdf">
          xv6: A simple, Unix-like teaching operating system</a>
        by R. Cox, F. Kaashoek, and R. Morris.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able
      to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Demonstrate proficiency in the kernel and user mode
        functionalities of operating systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigate and work effectively with complex operating systems
        such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contribute high-quality code to a working kernel while
        adhering to best practices and maintaining system integrity.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>
      You will get 3 unexcused absences for sickness or personal
      reasons. If an emergency comes up requiring you to miss more
      than 3, you need to send me an email ahead of class requesting
      an excused absence. If I decide that it is indeed a valid
      request, I will make it an excused absence. Otherwise, you will
      not get credit for that class attendance. Do not expect to get
      many, if any, excused absences.
    </p>
    <h2>Class Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      Class sessions are twice a week and last 75 minutes on T/Th from
      11am-12:15pm. Each class will have both required readings as
      well as required code to review in preparation for the class
      topic. These are not optional and will affect the participation
      grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class session will start with a recitation of a short
      passage of Scripture and prayer (5 minutes) followed by an
      interactive lecture with content and examples. Students are
      encouraged to ask questions at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class sessions will be recorded through Zoom, Panopto or both.
      In accordance with FERPA regulations, these recordings are only
      for the use of students in the course and may not be shared or
      forwarded to anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please bring a laptop (Mac, Windows, or Linux) to class each day
      with the appropriate code available.
    </p>
    <h2>COURSE ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING</h2>
    <p>Grades in this class will be assigned based on the following:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Participation (10%)</strong> &ndash; Students are
      expected to come prepared to play an active role in class
      discussions and to ask relevant and insightful questions.
      Periodically, I will ask students to submit questions for
      Q&amp;A sessions. This will be graded on a scale of 0 to 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check-off meetings (20%)</strong> &ndash; During the
      check-off meetings, I will ask you a few questions about your
      lab solution. I expect to hold 3 check-off meetings per student
      for randomly selected labs. These will be graded on a scale of 0
      to 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Labs (50%)</strong> &ndash; Each lab will be graded out
      of 100% and they are all equally weighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exams (20%) </strong>&ndash; There will be two equally
      weighted exams &ndash; a midterm and a final exam. The midterm
      will take place during week 8 of the semester covering course
      concepts introduced up to that point. The Final Exam will be
      cumulative for the entire semester and administered during
      finals week. The exams will be open-book, open-notes but closed
      network &ndash; composed of short answers and some small bits of
      code. They will be on paper, and they will be timed. We will
      have review sessions for each exam the session or week before.
