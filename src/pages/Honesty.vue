    <h1>ACADEMIC HONESTY</h1>
    <p>
      Northwest University expects honesty from students in all areas,
      including their academic lives. Academic dishonesty is a serious
      violation of Christian standards and may result in the student
      receiving an "F" in the course, being dismissed from
      the course, or possibly being dismissed from the University.
      Instances of academic dishonesty are typically reported to the
      Provost's Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Academic dishonesty includes cheating on assignments or
      examinations, submitting the same (or essentially the same)
      paper in more than one course without prior consent of the
      current assigning professor(s), sabotaging another
      student's work, and plagiarizing. Plagiarism is defined as
      "using someone else's ideas or phrasing and
      representing those ideas or phrasing as our own, either on
      purpose or through carelessness" (MLA).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any student disciplined by a faculty member for alleged academic
      dishonesty has the right to appeal the disciplinary action. The
      student should initiate his/her appeal according to procedures
      outlined in the Northwest University Student Academic Appeals
      Policy, which is available in the Provost's Office or the
      Student Development Office.

    <h2>Use of AI &amp; Web Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Northwest University recognizes the potential of artificial
      intelligence (often referred to as "generative AI")
      to support research, innovation, and learning. However, the
      University also acknowledges the possibility of misuse. As an
      extension of the NU Academic Honestly policy, your
      responsibility is to ensure your use of AI upholds the values of
      the Northwest University academic community, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You cannot simply copy and paste code from the web, AI, or
        another student.
        <strong>All code must be your own and you must type it in and
          get it working yourself</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you get an idea from the web, AI, or in collaboration
        with anyone (student, parent, friend, etc.), then
        <strong>you must clearly attribute that code in a comment
          immediately preceding the code and outlining what you
          used from that source</strong>. This does not mean that you can copy the entire code from
        the web or AI just because you attributed it - it must
        still be your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>When submitting a query to AI or the web, do not simply
          submit the lab function or the entire assignment</strong>. Instead, AI and Web queries should be used to look
        up the
        details for using an API or how to solve a 2-3 phrase
        problem like "splitting a string into a list".
      </li>
      <li>
        If you
        <strong>fill in an entire lab function with code from the web
          or AI, then you have not written the code even if you
          retype it yourself</strong>
        and it will be considered cheating.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Doing multiple iterations with ChatGPT is considered a
          single query</strong>
        and does not constitute your work but ChatGPT's work.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
      You are welcome to discuss the labs (and homework) with other
      students, but all your written work and code must be your own
      and must carefully acknowledge all the contributions of ideas by
      others, whether from classmates or from sources you have read.
      Please don't look at anyone else's code for the labs or
      homework.
