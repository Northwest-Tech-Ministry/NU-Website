      <b>Spring 2025</b>: INTC 4383 will be taught in Barton 200,
      Tuesday and Thursdays from 11:00am to 12:30pm.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ambitious software engineers will refine their engineering
      expertise by immersing themselves in the design and
      implementation of operating systems. The curriculum covers
      critical topics such as virtual memory, file systems, threads,
      interrupts, system calls, inter-process communication, and other
      foundational technologies that form the OS kernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through hands-on labs, students will enhance and extend xv6, a
      RISC-V multi-processor OS modeled after Unix v6, gaining
      invaluable practical experience in kernel-level implementation.
      Armed with this deep understanding and mastery of xv6, students
      will be well-equipped to navigate and innovate within modern
      operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and BSD.
