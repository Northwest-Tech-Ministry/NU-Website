    <h1>INTC 4383: Operating Systems and Networks</h1>
    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ambitious software engineers will refine their engineering
      expertise by immersing themselves in the design and
      implementation of operating systems. The curriculum covers
      critical topics such as virtual memory, file systems, threads,
      interrupts, system calls, inter-process communication, and other
      foundational technologies that form the OS kernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through hands-on labs, students will enhance and extend xv6, a
      RISC-V multi-processor OS modeled after Unix v6, gaining
      invaluable practical experience in kernel-level implementation.
      Armed with this deep understanding and mastery of xv6, students
      will be well-equipped to navigate and innovate within modern
      operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and BSD.

    <h2>About the Instructor</h2>
    <p>
      My passion is empowering people to create and achieve their
      dreams through technology. Over the last three decades,
      I&rsquo;ve contributed to a wide range of technological
      advancements, from low-level graphics and developer toolkits to
      web browsers, cloud services, and mobile apps. I grew up in New
      York, where I became a Christian at a young age, and later
      studied Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
      After graduation, I joined Microsoft, relocating to Seattle, WA,
      where I have lived and worked for the past 30 years. I am
      blessed with seven children, including one who graduated from
      Northwest University and now serves as a Chi Alpha missionary in
      Alaska. During my time at Microsoft, I was a frequent speaker at
      Microsoft Developer conferences, introducing key technologies
      such as Windows Terminal, Windows Subsystem for Linux and
      Android, Silverlight, and various developer toolkits. My
      expertise spans multiple programming languages, with a primary
      focus on C++, C#, and Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I serve as an adjunct professor of computer science
      at Northwest University, while also serving on the executive
      boards for Bible Quiz, Northwest University, and my local
      church. In my free time, I enjoy coding for Bible quiz
      ministries, biking, and boating.

    <p>
      This course is based on the xv6 teaching operating system
      developed at MIT and taught at many schools. The labs and
      curriculum also are based on the MIT Operating Systems course
      and we are greatful for them sharing this material with the
      world. We are also grateful to the students and teaching staff
      at MIT and other schools for their many contributions.
